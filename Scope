Scope of the System:

Develop a web application for comparing share prices over time.
Implement charting functionalities to visually represent share price data.
Provide a user-friendly interface for users to input stock symbols and view corresponding price comparisons.
Ensure the system is robust and scalable to handle large amounts of data and concurrent user requests.
Utilize Java programming language for backend development.
Implement data retrieval mechanisms to fetch share price data from reliable sources.
Ensure compatibility with different web browsers and devices.
Key Requirements:

User Interface:

Intuitive and user-friendly interface for inputting stock symbols and viewing price comparisons.
Interactive charts to visualize share price data over time.
Ability to customize chart views (e.g., time range, comparison metrics).
Backend Development:

Utilize Java for backend development to ensure robustness and scalability.
Implement APIs or data retrieval mechanisms to fetch share price data from reliable sources (e.g., financial APIs, databases).
Implement data processing and manipulation functionalities to prepare share price data for charting.
Ensure secure handling of user inputs and data.
Scalability:

Design the application architecture to handle a large number of users and concurrent requests.
Utilize scalable technologies and architectures (e.g., microservices, cloud infrastructure) to support scalability requirements.
Robustness:

Implement error handling and validation mechanisms to handle unexpected user inputs and system failures.
Conduct thorough testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and stress tests, to ensure the reliability and robustness of the system.
Performance:

Optimize the application's performance to ensure fast response times for data retrieval and chart rendering.
Implement caching mechanisms to reduce the load on external data sources and improve overall performance.
Compatibility:

Ensure cross-browser compatibility to support different web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
Implement responsive design principles to ensure compatibility with various devices (e.g., desktops, tablets, smartphones).
Data Privacy and Security:

Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure user access to the application.
Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR) when handling user data.
Encrypt sensitive data transmission to prevent unauthorized access.
By fulfilling these requirements, the Share Price Comparison web application will provide users with a reliable and scalable platform for comparing share prices and making informed investment decisions.
